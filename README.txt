# Cocoa Production Analysis (Ghana & Ivory Coast)

This project analyzes cocoa production data for Ghana and Ivory Coast using Python and Matplotlib.

## Files
- `ghana_cocoa.csv`: Dataset for Ghana (Year, Area harvested, Yield, Production)
- `ivorycoast_cocoa.csv`: Dataset for Ivory Coast
- `cocoa_analysis.py`: Python script to load data, generate scatter plots, bar charts, and combined panels
- `cocoa_production.pdf`: Output plot saved as PDF (generated after running the script)
- `README.txt`: This file with instructions

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended).
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Place all files in the same folder.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cocoa_analysis.py
   ```
5. The script will:
   - Generate scatter plots and bar charts separately (Task 2)
   - Generate a combined 4-panel plot with annotations (Tasks 3 & 4)
   - Save the combined plot as `cocoa_production.pdf`
